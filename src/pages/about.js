        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>WRMC is located at Middlebury College, in Middlebury, Vermont, and is entirely student-run. We are dedicated to providing a diverse range of alternative programming both locally, to the Champlain Valley, and internationally, to the far-reaching Middlebury College community. In a time when college radio stations are becoming less prevalent, we strive to demonstrate the value of the truly unique medium that is small college radio.
